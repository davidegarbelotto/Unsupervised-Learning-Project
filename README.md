# Unsupervised Learning Project
The goal of this project is to analyse some unsupervised deep learning problems through the implementation of different architectures:
- Convolutional autoencoder for image classification: performance analysis varying the size of the encoded space. 
- Denoising autoencoder: add some noise to images and try to remove it through the autoencoder.
- Classification Neural Network: obtained by fine-tuning the encoder previously implemented as a feature extractor. 
- Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN): generate image samples.
